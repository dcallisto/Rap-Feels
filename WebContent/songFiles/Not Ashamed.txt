You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say
You want my love, but you want it your own way
You like to ride it, depending on the day
You're not ashamed, your feelings always change
I don't like what I've been going through
But I gotta keep my chest from falling for you
You wanna talk to me,but don't know what to say (don't know what to say)
You got my love, but you want it your own way (wanna run away)
You like to ride, depending on the day (your feelings always change)
You're not ashamed, your feelings always change (You're not ashamed)
Are you with me, or are you against me
Cause when I see you, you move too quickly
Fifth time in the week and you're leaving
Then we don't even speak on the weekend
Next week, it's baby forgive me
This time it's different, believe me
Different day, but the same old story
Not ashamed, of the way you ignore me
Prove yourself to me
Prove yourself to me
Cause I'm not the type, to give it up for no reason
Show yourself to me
Tell me who you wanna be
But you always got to leave
(Show me, gotta open up, show me)
You're not ashamed
You're not ashamed
But you want it your own way
You're not ashamed
Depending on the day
Your feelings change
You love me, you hate me
You want me, but then you resent me
I'm ashamed of the way that you treat me
Scheming for you is way too easy
What's your number, I'm about to delete it
Same mistake, I'm about to repeat it
We're both too drunk to be speaking
I'm not playing this game (game, game)
Cause I'm not the type, to give it up, give it up
Prove yourself to me
Tell me honestly
You could show yourself to me but
You're not ashamed
You're not ashamed
Said you want it your own way
You're not ashamed
Depending on the day (your feelings always change)
Your feelings change
You're lying to my face (you're lying to my face)
Driving me insane (driving me insane)
Playing all these games
You're lying to my face
That's some news I can't erase
Ooh, ooh
You're not ashamed
Ooh, you want my love
But you want it your own way
Love to ride depending on the day
Your feelings change
You wanna play with me
And act like we're ok
You want my love
But you want it your own way
You love to ride depending on the day
You're not ashamed
Your feelings always change
