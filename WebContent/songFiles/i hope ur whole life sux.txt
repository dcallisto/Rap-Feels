Sittin', thinkin' slow, I'm all alone in my hotel
I think it's Albuquerque, I forgot what day it is, you fuckin' hurt me
I don't know, I'm flyin' girls around the world to validate myself
I think it's funny, yo
Lololol's the only L's I'm takin' shots at myself, that's the truth
Close my eyes, this girl I barely knew felt just like you
Instagram be feelin' like the grocery store, I pick and choose
I got a lot in my account but I ain't got shit to lose
The truth
Yeah, is I've been up for days on cocaine
The truth
Is I've been up for days tryin' not to think about you
I hope that I'm the reason that you can't sleep
I hope that your whole life sucks without me
The truth
Is I've been up for days thinkin' 'bout you
I've been up for days thinkin' 'bout you
I've been up for days thinkin' 'bout you
Once again, you ain't made no time for me, ain't no surprise to me
All my friends are really dead, this ain't no "XO Llif3" for me
Mama wasn't 'round that much growin' up, it's all good
Rather pay the mortgage than to see my bro in the hood
Daddy saw me on TV, he proud that he adopted me
He called me bugging out 'cause now his radio play "do re mi"
But everybody wants something, he ain't ask for nothing
Every time I wanted something, he said mow some lawns
"Get a job, have a backup plan B and a C
And have fun in moderation, work harder, ain't shit for free"
The truth
Yeah, is I've been up for days on cocaine
The truth
Is I've been up for days tryin' not to think about you
I hope that I'm the reason that you can't sleep
I hope that your whole life sucks without me
The truth
Is I've been up for days thinkin' 'bout you
Is I've been up for days thinkin' 'bout you
Is I've been up for days thinkin' 'bout you
