I would know exactly how you felt but we don't talk now
Used to hold you naked in my arms, I know you're gone now
Everything was right and now it's wrong now
It's how I'm feeling on god now (yeah)
Post another snap, you thinking you are a big star now
Look at who I follow just to stalk now, quit playing 'round
You a klondike, you'd do anything for a bar now
See you around the world, you make the distance seem far now
Oh, oh, oh-oh, I leave you alone
Make me wanna go, oh, oh-oh
Make me wanna leave my hometown
Away from Hollywood girls in the valley
I know that all 'em tweets you posting is about me
I got to go, oh, oh-oh
I'll stay out of Cali for a while (Cali for a while)
I'll stay out of Cali for you now
I'll stay out of Cali for a while
Every shorty think they too cool for you
But you get used to it
That's just how it is in California (in California)
Swear they love it when you act like you don't want 'em
They all biting on the check and they know who got 'em next
If it ain't about money then they can't do nothing for ya
They gonna take what they can give regardless
She just want shove a little rich nigga with a little oh ye
Someone that she know won't ever put up with the bullshit
Someone she can get drunk and get high and be no good with
Someone who see through her without looking no
I ain't got no time for these hoes
And I might lose my mind
(If I don't go)
Get some piece of mind
